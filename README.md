# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet
  
## Overview
  This project visualizes recent earthquake data provided by the USGS (United States Geological Survey). Using Leaflet.js and D3, it plots earthquakes on an interactive map, with marker size reflecting magnitude and color representing depth.

# Dataset Source
USGS GeoJSON Feed
The dataset used:
All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days

# Technologies Used
 * Leaflet.js (Map rendering)

 * D3.js (Data loading)

 * HTML/CSS/JavaScript

 * GeoJSON (for earthquake + tectonic plate boundaries)

## Features
Interactive map centered on global coordinates

Circle markers for each earthquake:

Size = magnitude

Color = depth

Legend explaining color scale for depth

Popups showing:

Magnitude

Location

Optional Bonus: Tectonic plate boundaries overlaid (orange lines)
